Goal:
Making a gradient generator
It has both options of picking colors & generating random values
it displays the CSS rule of the gradient inside a heading

my extras:
control opacity
control direction of the gradient

plan and steps:

1- getting two colors inputs
2- make a function that generate random colors on click
3- dynamically change the background as user selects
4- show value in a heading

Off to work:

1st- Making HTML (Done)
2nd- adding minimal CSS in particular the GRADIENT for sub and main display

CSS GRADIENT SYNTAX:
It goes in the background property not background color
first we state type of gradient: linear/radial gradient
after it within parenthesis we can add the degree or angle of the graident, or specify its direction.
then we add the colors and spereate them with a comma
notes:
when we pick radial we place "circle" instead of the angle or the direction
we spereate between the colors and direction with comma too
after adding the colors we can add a percentage to indecate where the color start
The gradient can take more than two inputs

background: rgb(170,183,224);
background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(170,183,224,1) 0%, rgba(174,67,244,1) 52%, rgba(186,91,78,1) 100%);

3- Start with JS:
A) Target and grab the needed elements.
B) Make the normal gradient function
